Just a remark  for the 3rd response.  
With Antoine , we have mentionned the negligeable role of the background integral 
(see conclusion of our article PRD 99, 104079 (2019)) ansd we didn't expect that 
at the beginning  because we know that the background integral in other domains 
has a role and its asymptotically evaluation allows it to be interpreted as direct 
reflected rays. it was a surprise for us in the case of black hole 
(We must believe that black holes are special objects alos ECOs !!!!).
