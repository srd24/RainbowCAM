In response to referee:

(i) Three points: Limit of alpha -> 0, black hole case, 
and smoothness of potential:

	(a) Limit of alpha -> 0 iff M/R -> 0 (branch dissapears). SEE LINE 760
	(b) Emphasise black hole is different case/remove ambiguity. LINE 671 and 763.
	(c) Even if continuous, then may have non-zero R due to discontinous
	nth derivitave of potential. SEE LINE 762
	
	Make changes to text for (a-c). 
	

(ii) Role of length scales in WKB expansion, magnitude of higher order terms

	Make this more explicit in text. ADDED SENTENCE LINE 671

	also for response: note that although M/R does enter in eqs 30 and 31, the 
	Wronskian can be evaluated at $r* \approx 1/\omega < R$, and thus O(M r*^2 / R^3 ) 
	= O(M \omega)^-2 O(M/R)^3 and we are limited to M/R order 1 or smaller. 


(iii) Qualitative argument for no. of RPs needed for accuracy. 
And neglecting background integral.

	Change text to remark on suprising result that background is negligible.
	Change text to suggest further work needed (asymptotics, semiclassical)
	to make interpretation and qualitative argument, and understand role 
	of background. We focus on proof of concept, early stages.
	We simply stop summation over RPs when it converges (quantitative argument).

comments not put in for now:

\tom{Speculatively, this could be related to the long range nature of gravitational scattering by compact bodies 
(it is not just the body that is scattering, but the bodies extended gravitational field). By contrast, in acoustics, quantum mechanics, 
and optics [\emph{find citations}] the scatterer generally has a short range influence.}
