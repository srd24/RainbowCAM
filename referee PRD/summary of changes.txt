In response to referee:

(i) Three points: Limit of alpha -> 0, black hole case, 
and smoothness of potential:

	(a) Limit of alpha -> 0 iff M/R -> 0 (branch dissapears). 
	(b) Black hole argument of Mohamed. Emphasise this is different case.
	(c) Even if continuous, then may have non-zero R due to discontinous
	nth derivitave of potential.
	
	Make changes to text for (a-c). 

(ii) Role of length scales in WKB expansion, magnitude of higher order terms

	Yes M/R must be small. Make this more explicit in text.

(iii) Qualitative argument for no. of RPs needed for accuracy. 
And neglecting background integral.

	Change text to remark on suprising result that background is negligible.
	Change text to suggest further work needed (asymptotics, semiclassical)
	to make interpretation and qualitative argument, and understand role 
	of background. We focus on proof of concept, early stages.
	We simply stop summation over RPs when it converges (quantitative argument).
